# Angular2 YT Player
This is a simple youtube player based on latest version of [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli "Angular Cli"), [ng2-youtube-player](https://github.com/orizens/ng2-youtube-player "ng2 youtube player") (used for youtube iFrame API), SCSS (CSS3), HTML5 and webkit functions.

This player is compatible only with Chrome/webkit browsers because in future I want to implement [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/ 'NWjs website') for compiling the code in Windows/Mac OS X/Linux desktop app.

## Usage
For typescript/angular2 development
1. Install [NodeJS 6.10.2+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node JS Download")
2. Install latest version of [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli "Angular Cli")
`npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. Download/clone repository then install the player by
`npm install` in root folder
4. Run the player by
`npm start` in root folder

For SCSS development (after you downloaded/cloned the project)
1. Install [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install "Sass website")
2. Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp "Gulp download")
`npm install -g gulp`
3. In cloned folder in **src** folder
`npm install`
4. Start compiling the SCSS files by
`gulp`
